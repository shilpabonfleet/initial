We need a few details of each Customers:
Customer ID / Name / Company etc — to identify them
Recency (R)  (repayment_date)How many days ago was their last purchase? Deduct most recent purchase date from today to calculate the recency value. 1 day ago? 14 days ago? 500 days ago?
Frequency (F)  repayment_amount How many times has the customer purchased from our store? For example, if someone placed 10 orders over a period of time, their frequency is 10.
Monetary (M) repayment=transactionHow many $$ (or whatever is your currency of calculation) has this customer spent? Simply total up the money from all transactions to get the M value.
